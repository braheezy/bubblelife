Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing an OpenGL application using Go (Golang) that presents a 3D rendition of Conway's Game of Life. The application will feature spheres behaving like bubbles within a 3D environment, adhering to the game's population rules extended into three dimensions. Users will have the ability to navigate the scene using a fly camera, exploring both the interior and exterior of the containing shape. The exterior environment will be a simple world scene rendered using a cubemap. The overall visual experience will be enhanced with pastel colors, particles, and other effects to create a mystical and engaging scene.
Objectives

    Develop a Go application utilizing OpenGL for rendering.
    Implement a 3D version of Conway's Game of Life with spheres as cells.
    Enable user navigation with a fly camera inside and outside the containing shape.
    Create an exterior world scene using a cubemap.
    Enhance visuals with pastel colors, particle effects, and other aesthetic elements.

Functional Requirements
1. 3D Game of Life Implementation

    1.1 Cells as Spheres
        Represent each cell in the Game of Life as a 3D sphere.
        Spheres should exhibit bubble-like behavior, including movement and interactions.

    1.2 Game Rules in Three Dimensions
        Extend Conway's Game of Life rules to operate in three dimensions.
        Apply rules uniformly in all three spatial directions within the containing shape.

    1.3 Containing Shape
        Use a rectangular prism (box) as the initial containing shape.
        Design the system to allow for different containing shapes in the future.

2. User Navigation

    2.1 Fly Camera Implementation
        Implement a fly camera system for free navigation.
        Allow users to move seamlessly inside and outside the containing shape.
        Provide intuitive controls for movement and viewing direction.

3. Exterior World Scene

    3.1 Cubemap Environment
        Render a simple world scene outside the containing shape using a cubemap.
        Source or create textures for the cubemap as no assets are currently available.
        Ensure the exterior scene complements the interior simulation aesthetically.

4. Visual Enhancements

    4.1 Aesthetic Elements
        Apply pastel colors to spheres and the environment for a pleasing visual effect.
        Integrate particle effects to enhance the mystical atmosphere.
        Explore additional visual effects to make the scene engaging (e.g., lighting effects, shaders).

Non-Functional Requirements
5. Performance

    5.1 Efficiency
        Ensure smooth rendering at a minimum of 30 frames per second on standard hardware.
        Optimize calculations and rendering processes to maintain performance.

6. Usability

    6.1 User Experience
        Design intuitive navigation controls (e.g., keyboard and mouse inputs).
        Keep on-screen interfaces minimal to maintain immersion.

7. Compatibility

    7.1 Platform Support
        Ensure the application runs on major operating systems: Windows, macOS, and Linux.
        Verify compatibility with common hardware configurations supporting OpenGL.

Constraints

    C.1 Development Language
        The application must be developed using Go (Golang).

    C.2 Rendering API
        OpenGL will be used for all rendering tasks.

    C.3 Assets and Textures
        No pre-existing assets or textures are available for the cubemap or other visual elements.
        Any required assets must be created or appropriately sourced.

Assumptions

    A.1 User Familiarity
        Users have basic familiarity with 3D navigation controls.

    A.2 Hardware Support
        Users' systems support OpenGL and have adequate performance capabilities.

    A.3 Expandability
        The design allows for future enhancements without significant refactoring.

Future Enhancements

    F.1 Diverse Containing Shapes
        Implement additional containing shapes (e.g., spheres, complex polygons).

    F.2 Real-Time Interaction
        Allow users to modify simulation parameters during runtime (e.g., speed, rules).

    F.3 Advanced Visual Effects
        Introduce advanced shaders and post-processing effects.

    F.4 Sound Integration
        Add ambient sounds or music to enhance the immersive experience.
